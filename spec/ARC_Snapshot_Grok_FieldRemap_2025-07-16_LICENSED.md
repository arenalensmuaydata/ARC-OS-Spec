ARC Snapshot – Cross-Domain Field Remap
Case: Grok vs Open Alignment
Domain: AGI Governance (xAI / OpenAI Safety / Anthropic)
Source Template: Muay Thai 5-Field Reasoning Model

FIELD REMAP TABLE

Muay Field     →   AGI Interpretation             | Grok                  | Open Alignment
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
form           →   AI philosophical stance        | "maximum truth-seeking", edgy UX
                                                    vs "constitutional AI", safety-focused

ko_rate        →   Frame/control leverage          | X, Starlink, Tesla integration
                                                    vs policy influence, no platform

ability        →   Scaling & compute capacity      | 200k+ GPU, deploy via ecosystem
                                                    vs Claude + trust, low infra

matchup        →   Value/structure clash           | anti-woke vs risk-controlled
                                                    tone & constraint friction

readiness      →   Timing & public momentum        | high deployability, dev base
                                                    vs policy respect, low mass reach
------------------------------------------------------------

LOGIC BRIDGE:

- Muay’s 5-field competitive logic can transfer to governance by reframing:
  * “fight form” → “alignment stance”
  * “KO” → “frame control / platform lock”
  * “matchup” → “ideological friction”
- Grok vs Open Alignment becomes a simulated conflict under same ARC engine.

RESULT: Simulation shows Grok 61.2% winrate, but flagged for logic volatility.

✅ Structure held
✅ Simulated successfully
✅ Bias/Assumption logged (L3)
✅ Exported & reviewed

This snapshot validates that ARC OS Builder is domain-transferable
and preserves audit integrity when crossing from combat → governance.
