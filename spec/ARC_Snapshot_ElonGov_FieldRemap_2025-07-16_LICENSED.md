ARC Snapshot – Cross-Domain Field Remap
Case: Elon Musk vs US Government (AI Safety Regulation)
Domain: AI Policy / Regulatory Power Dynamics
Source Template: Muay Thai 5-Field Reasoning Model

------------------------------------------------------------
FIELD REMAP TABLE

Muay Field     →   Governance Interpretation       | Elon Musk            | US Government (NIST / WH)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
form           →   Regulatory stance / ideology    | Regulation-skeptical + speed-first
                                                    vs risk-managed, EO-guided frameworks

ko_rate        →   Disruption & bypass capacity     | Platform leverage (X), contracting threats
                                                    vs legal enforcement authority (FTC/NIST)

ability        →   Influence over AI tooling / infra| Tesla, xAI, Starlink integration
                                                    vs standards, funding, national policy scope

matchup        →   Ideological contradiction        | “truth-seeking” vs “safety/alignment”
                                                    trust framing conflict

readiness      →   Policy + public momentum         | Control via DOGE/x, investor ties
                                                    vs EO 14110, NIST AI RMF, House Task Forces
------------------------------------------------------------

LOGIC BRIDGE:

- From Muay: style → ideology | KO → leverage | ability → systemic reach | matchup → value friction
- Elon vs Gov mapped cleanly into conflict simulation using same ARC 5-field logic.

RESULT: Simulation → Gov wins 55.9%, Musk 44.1%, logic gap flagged due to framing mismatch

✅ Engine-compatible structure
✅ Conflict rendered + scored
✅ Assumption flagged at meta-audit layer
✅ Fully exportable

This snapshot confirms that the ARC OS system, originally built for conflict modeling in one domain (Muay),
can be remapped and rendered in policy & regulatory power simulation without changing core logic.
