Every single file had role and unique Its easier to ask your LLM how its work after you uploaded, paste or attach spec to LLM

I can tell you that all of these can structure on every or most AI model, Agent or whatever you want because its logic framework for transparency | all of these can work and deployed, its in early stage maybe not user-frienly but you can try ❤️
