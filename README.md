# ARC OS ‚Äî Model-Free Logic Engine for Auditable Reasoning

![ARC OS 1-pager](assets/ARC_OS_1pager.png)

ARC OS is a 5-layer logic framework designed to create a shared language of thought between humans and AI. It's model-free (no weights or prompts required), domain-agnostic, and fully auditable‚Äîideal for building traceable decisions, reducing bias, and bridging symbolic reasoning with LLMs. Think of it as infrastructure for transparent AI workflows.

This repo contains the core specs, examples, and snapshots. It's early-stage, so it may not be user-friendly yet, but you can test it manually by pasting files into any LLM (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Grok, Gemini).

## Key Features
- **Layer 1: Input Normalization (Muay Glasses)**: Normalizes data into numbers (adaptable beyond Muay Thai to any domain).
- **Layer 2: Prediction Structure (Seannoi Core)**: Calculates logic tilt % (not probabilistic prediction‚Äîfocus on balanced reasoning).
- **Layer 3: Meta-Intent Oversight (Advisor Layer)**: Audits Layers 1 and 2 for consistency and intent.
- **Logic Renderer: ARC Builder**: Generates structured logic trees, self-checks, and outputs that both AI and humans can understand and audit.
- **Meta-Layer Audit Builder: ARC Supervisor**: Ensures overall framework integrity.
- **Snapshots**: Real-use simulations (e.g., ElonGov, Grok) showing field remapping for cross-domain applications‚Äîyou can use ARC Builder to remap fields or integrate Layers 1/2.

Each layer has a unique role, making the stack modular. It's logic-based for transparency, works with most AI models/agents, and can be deployed (with permission).

## How to Try It (No Coding Needed)
1. Download `arc_logic_stack_v1.5.zip` from the releases or clone this repo.
2. Paste or attach a spec file (e.g., `ARC_Builder_EN_v1.0_LICENSED.md`) into an LLM.
3. Prompt: "Use this as the reasoning framework" or "Be this one" for testing.
4. Ask queries like "Render in L3" or any logic-based question‚Äîthe LLM will output structured responses (logic trees, self-checks, etc.).
5. Results vary by LLM‚Äîit's manual for now, but powerful for audits.

If it helps with your prompts or decisions, let me know!

## Common Questions
- **Do I need coding skills?** No‚Äîjust paste into an LLM for testing.
- **Is it a full app?** No, specs for manual testing or building tools.
- **Different from GPT?** Yes‚Äîadds auditable structure before AI responds.
- **Works on web?** No, but you can build it into one (permission required).
